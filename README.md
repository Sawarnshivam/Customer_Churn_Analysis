# Customer_Churn_Analysis
*Overview*

This project analyzes customer churn based on various factors such as contract type, monthly charges, tenure, and other service-related attributes. The dataset used in this analysis is Customer Churn.csv, and the findings are documented in the Jupyter Notebook (TCA.ipynb).

*Project Structure*

Customer Churn.csv: The dataset containing customer details and churn information.

TCA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and churn prediction.

Teco Customer Churn Analysis.pdf: A report summarizing the key findings.

*Analysis Steps*

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Converting categorical variables

Standardizing numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Churn rate calculation

Visualizing customer attributes vs. churn

Predictive Modeling:

Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

Model evaluation and performance metrics

*Key Findings*

Churn Rate: Approximately 26.54% of customers have churned.

Factors Affecting Churn:

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

Higher monthly charges correlate with a higher churn rate.

Customers with tech support and online security tend to stay longer.

*How to Use*

Open TCA.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells step by step to analyze the data.

Modify and experiment with different models for better predictions.

*Requirements*

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

*Conclusion*

This analysis helps businesses understand customer churn patterns and take proactive measures to improve retention strategies.
